# Labseq

# Description

This is a sample Todo list program written in Quarkus and Angular.

Frontend: [labseq-frontend](/frontend) Angular

Backend: [labseq-backend](/backend) Quarkus

# Local Build & Deployment

Both projects have their own README.md files with instructions to start the application in local.

1. [Frontend README.md](/frontend/README.md)
2. [Backend README.md](/backend/README.md)

# How It Works

Frontend application runs on localhost:4200

Backend application runs on localhost:8080

The frontend will call the REST API exposed by the Backend for Labseq algorithm.
